        Loki Laufeyson, known by adoption as Loki Odinson and by his title as the God of Mischief, 
        is a fictional character portrayed by Tom Hiddleston in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) 
        media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and the Norse mythological 
        god of the same name. Loki first appeared in Thor (2011) and has since become an important recurring 
        figure of the MCU; following the original Loki's death in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), a variant 
        of him from an alternate timeline is introduced in Avengers: Endgame (2019), diverging from the 
        events of The Avengers (2012), headlining the television series Loki (2021) alongside Sylvie, a female 
        variant of him who is his love interest.

    <p>
        The mythical figure Loki preceded Thor in making his first Marvel Comics appearance, depicted in 
        the science fiction/fantasy anthology title Timely Comics' publication Venus No. 6 (August 1949) 
        as a member of the Olympian gods exiled to the Underworld. However, the current version of Loki 
        made his first official Marvel appearance was in Journey into Mystery No. 85 (October 1962), 
        where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers 
        and co-writers Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and he was redesigned by Jack Kirby. As one of Thor's a
        rch-nemeses, Loki frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like Journey into Mystery and 
        Thor, as well as other Marvel Universe titles such as The Avengers and X-Men,[7] as well as brief 
        appearances in the Spider-Man and Defenders comic series.
