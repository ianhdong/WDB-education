        Loki Laufeyson, known by adoption as Loki Odinson and by his title as the God of Mischief,
        is a fictional character portrayed by Tom Hiddleston in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)
        media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and the Norse mythological
        god of the same name. Loki first appeared in Thor (2011) and has since become an important recurring
        figure of the MCU; following the original Loki's death in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), a variant
        of him from an alternate timeline is introduced in Avengers: Endgame (2019), diverging from the
        events of The Avengers (2012), headlining the television series Loki (2021) alongside Sylvie, a female
        variant of him who is his love interest.

    <p>
        The mythical figure Loki preceded Thor in making his first Marvel Comics appearance, depicted in
        the science fiction/fantasy anthology title Timely Comics' publication Venus No. 6 (August 1949)
        as a member of the Olympian gods exiled to the Underworld. However, the current version of Loki
        made his first official Marvel appearance was in Journey into Mystery No. 85 (October 1962),
        where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers
        and co-writers Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and he was redesigned by Jack Kirby. As one of Thor's a
        rch-nemeses, Loki frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like Journey into Mystery and
        Thor, as well as other Marvel Universe titles such as The Avengers and X-Men,[7] as well as brief
        appearances in the Spider-Man and Defenders comic series.

            Early Life
        </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Loki was born a Frost Giant and abandoned as an infant by his father Laufey, only to be found by Odin 
        during an invasion of the realm of the Frost Giants in Jotunheim. Odin used magic to make Loki
        appear Asgardian and raised him as a son alongside Odin's biological son, Thor. During his upbringing,
        Odin's wife Frigga taught Loki how to use magic.He used these powers throughout his life, constantly
        tricking his adoptive brother Thor, as well as pulling a heist on Earth under the alias D. B. Cooper.
        He was embittered throughout his upbringing, perceiving that he was neglected by Odin in favor of Thor,
        and thus growing closer to his adoptive mother Frigga instead.

            Betrayal of Asgard
        </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Hundreds of years later, in 2011, Loki watches as Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard.
        This is interrupted by Frost Giants, allowed in to Asgard by Loki, attempting to retrieve an artifact
        called the Casket, which was captured by Odin in a war centuries before. Loki then manipulates Thor
        into traveling to Jotunheim against Odin's order to confront Laufey, the Frost Giant leader. A battle
        ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races.
        Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After Odin exiles Thor
        to Earth, Loki confronts Odin about his parentage, and a weary Odin falls into the deep "Odinsleep" to recover
        his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the
        Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall,
        gatekeeper of the Bifröst—the means of traveling between worlds—to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their
        plan, Loki sends the Destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton, to pursue them and kill Thor. The
        Destroyer leaves Thor on the verge of death but his sacrifice sees him become worthy of returning from exile and
        he regains his powers and defeats the Destroyer. Afterward, Thor leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront
        Loki. In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life
        as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst, thus proving himself worthy to Odin. Thor arrives and fights
        Loki before destroying the Bifröst to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents
        the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but after Odin rejects
        Loki's pleas for approval, Loki allows himself to fall into the abyss.
